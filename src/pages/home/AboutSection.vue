            I was born in northeastern China, next to the capital Beijing. At the age of 7, my parents whisked me away
            to New Zealand where I grew up before I went to Australia for tertiary study. My double major in mechatronics 
            and computer science at the University of Melbourne made me very good at integrating hardware with software.
            This landed me my first job at an industrial IoT startup. I slowly transitioned to remote work, taking small
            freelance jobs and travelling the world while I'm at it!

            Programmers are seen as boring, but I'm here to prove otherwise! I think I lead a rather creative
            life. From a young age I loved to draw my own comics which now transitioned to pencil sketches. At
            university I acted in a musical production of Footloose and I finally learnt guitar to keep up the singing. 
            On the sports front I play tennis and row. Now that I have lived in Serbia for a year, I finally have a a 
            reason to support Djokovic.
